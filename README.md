# 365 Birthdays

> 🎂 Microsoft 365 Birthday Calendar Sync

Automatically sync birthdays from your Microsoft 365 contacts to a
dedicated calendar with reminders.

## About

This Python package uses the Microsoft Graph API to:

- Read contacts from your Microsoft 365 address book
- Extract birthday information from contacts
- Create and maintain a dedicated "Birthdays" calendar
- Generate calendar events for each contact's birthday
- Add reminders for birthday events

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- A Microsoft 365 account
- Access to Microsoft Entra admin center (formerly Azure AD) for app registration

## Setup

### 1. Register Application in Microsoft Entra

1. Go to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/)
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **App registrations**
3. Click **New registration**
4. Configure your app:
  - **Name**: 365 Birthdays Sync
  - **Supported account types**: Accounts in this organizational directory
    only (Single tenant)
  - **Redirect URI**: Leave empty for now
5. Click **Register**

### 2. Configure API Permissions

**For Interactive Use (Device Code Flow):**

1. In your app registration, go to **API permissions**
2. Click **Add a permission**
3. Select **Microsoft Graph** > **Delegated permissions**
4. Add the following permissions:
  - `Calendars.ReadWrite` - Create and manage calendar events
  - `Contacts.Read` - Read user contacts
  - `User.Read` - Sign in and read user profile
5. Click **Add permissions**
6. Click **Grant admin consent** (requires admin privileges)

**For Automated/Non-Interactive Use (Client Credentials Flow):**

For scenarios like GitHub Actions or scheduled scripts, you'll need **Application permissions** instead:

1. In your app registration, go to **API permissions**
2. Click **Add a permission**
3. Select **Microsoft Graph** > **Application permissions**
4. Add the following permissions:
  - `Calendars.ReadWrite` - Create and manage calendar events for all users
  - `Contacts.Read` - Read contacts in all mailboxes
5. Click **Add permissions**
6. Click **Grant admin consent** (requires admin privileges)

**Note:** Application permissions require admin consent and grant access to data across all users in the organization. Use with caution and follow the principle of least privilege.

### 3. Configure Authentication Method

The application supports two authentication methods:

**Option A: Device Code Flow (Interactive - Default)**

For local/interactive use:

1. Go to **Authentication** in your app registration
2. Under **Advanced settings** > **Allow public client flows**
3. Set **Enable the following mobile and desktop flows** to **Yes**
4. Click **Save**

**Option B: Client Secret Flow (Non-Interactive - for Automation)**

For automated scenarios like GitHub Actions:

1. Go to **Certificates & secrets** in your app registration
2. Under **Client secrets**, click **New client secret**
3. Add a description (e.g., "GitHub Actions Secret")
4. Choose an expiration period
5. Click **Add**
6. **Important:** Copy the secret value immediately - it won't be shown again
7. Save this value as `CLIENT_SECRET` in your environment variables

**Choosing the Right Method:**
- **Device Code Flow**: Use for local development or manual runs. Requires user interaction.
- **Client Secret Flow**: Use for CI/CD pipelines, scheduled tasks, or any non-interactive automation.

**User Context in Client Secret Flow:**

When using client credentials (client secret), the application runs with **application-level permissions**, not as a specific user. This means:

- The app can access **any user's** contacts and calendars in the organization
- You must specify which user's data to sync by setting environment variables or modifying the code
- **By default, the app will need to be configured to target a specific user's mailbox**
- This is controlled via Microsoft Graph API calls using the user's UPN (User Principal Name) or user ID

To sync a specific user's data when using client credentials:
1. The admin must grant the appropriate application permissions
2. The application will need to specify the user context in API calls (e.g., `/users/{userPrincipalName}/contacts`)
3. You can set the target user via additional configuration (see "Advanced Configuration" below)

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

2. Edit `.env` and fill in your values:
  - `CLIENT_ID`: Application (client) ID from your app registration
  - `TENANT_ID`: Directory (tenant) ID from your app registration
  - `CLIENT_SECRET`: (Optional) Client secret for non-interactive authentication. If not provided, device code flow will be used.
  - `CALENDAR_NAME`: (Optional) Name of the calendar to create/use
    (default: "Birthdays")

### 5. Install the Package

Using uv (recommended):

```bash
uv sync
```

Or install directly:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Run the birthday sync:

```bash
uv run birthdays365
```

Or if installed globally:

```bash
birthdays365
```

The application will:

1. Prompt you to visit a URL and enter a code to authenticate
2. After authentication, it will access your Microsoft 365 data
3. Create a "Birthdays" calendar if it doesn't exist
4. Read all contacts with birthday information
5. Check for existing birthday events and update them if the birthday
   date has changed
6. Create recurring all-day calendar events for each new birthday with
   reminders enabled
7. Events recur annually on the birthday date

## Authentication Methods Explained

### Device Code Flow (Interactive)

When no `CLIENT_SECRET` is provided, the app uses device code authentication:

1. You run the application
2. It displays a URL and code
3. You visit the URL in a browser and enter the code
4. You authenticate with your Microsoft 365 account
5. The app runs with **your user context** - it accesses your contacts and calendar

**User Context:** The authenticated user (you)

### Client Secret Flow (Non-Interactive)

When `CLIENT_SECRET` is provided, the app uses client credentials authentication:

1. The app authenticates using CLIENT_ID, TENANT_ID, and CLIENT_SECRET
2. No user interaction required
3. The app runs with **application permissions**
4. It can access any user's data in the organization (subject to permissions)

**User Context:** The current implementation uses the **authenticated user's context** when using delegated permissions. When using application permissions with client credentials:

- **Current Behavior**: The application uses the `.default` scope which inherits from the permission grants. With delegated permissions, it will authenticate as the service principal, but Microsoft Graph API calls will need to specify which user's resources to access.
- **For Automated Scenarios**: To target a specific user's contacts and calendar, the application would need to be modified to use user-specific endpoints like:
  - `/users/{userPrincipalName}/contacts` instead of `/me/contacts`
  - `/users/{userPrincipalName}/calendars` instead of `/me/calendars`

**Important Limitation**: The current implementation is designed for interactive use with delegated permissions. For fully automated scenarios using application permissions, you would need to:

1. Grant **Application permissions** (not Delegated) in Azure AD:
   - `Calendars.ReadWrite` (Application permission)
   - `Contacts.Read` (Application permission)
2. Modify the code to specify a target user (e.g., via environment variable `TARGET_USER_UPN`)
3. Update API calls to use `/users/{userPrincipalName}/` instead of `/me/`

This would allow GitHub Actions or other automation to sync a specific user's birthdays without interactive login.

## Development

### Running Tests

The package includes a comprehensive test suite using pytest:

```bash
# Install development dependencies
uv sync --group dev

# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=birthdays365

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_calendar.py
```

### Code Quality

The project uses ruff for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check code quality
uv run ruff check src/ tests/

# Format code
uv run ruff format src/ tests/
```

### GitHub Actions Workflows

The repository includes automated workflows:

- **Tests** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`): Automatically runs the test
  suite on every push and pull request
- **Ruff** (`.github/workflows/ruff.yml`): Runs code quality checks
- **Birthday Sync** (`.github/workflows/sync.yml`): Automated daily
  birthday synchronization (requires repository secrets configuration)

To use the Birthday Sync workflow:

1. **Configure Application Permissions** (for automated sync):
   - In Microsoft Entra, add **Application permissions** (not Delegated):
     - `Calendars.ReadWrite` (Application)
     - `Contacts.Read` (Application)
   - Grant admin consent for these permissions
   - Create a client secret in **Certificates & secrets**

2. **Add Repository Secrets**:
   - Go to your repository **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**
   - Add the following repository secrets:
     - `CLIENT_ID` - Your Microsoft Entra application (client) ID
     - `TENANT_ID` - Your Microsoft Entra directory (tenant) ID
     - `CLIENT_SECRET` - Your client secret value (for non-interactive auth)
     - `CALENDAR_NAME` (optional) - Calendar name (defaults to "Birthdays")
     - `SENTRY_DSN` (optional) - Sentry DSN for error tracking

3. **Enable the Workflow**:
   - The workflow is scheduled to run daily at 6:00 AM UTC
   - You can also manually trigger it using the **Run workflow** button in the GitHub Actions tab

**Note**: When using client credentials (CLIENT_SECRET) with application permissions, the current implementation will need modification to specify which user's data to sync. See "Authentication Methods Explained" section above for details.

## Microsoft 365 Integration Guide

### What This App Does

The 365 Birthdays app integrates with your Microsoft 365 tenant to:

- Read contact information from your Microsoft 365 address book
- Extract birthday dates from contact profiles
- Create a dedicated "Birthdays" calendar in your Microsoft 365 account
- Generate recurring calendar events for each birthday
- Automatically update events if contact birthday information changes

### Required Microsoft 365 Setup

This application requires the following:

1. **Microsoft 365 Account**: A valid Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365)
  account with access to:
  - Outlook/Exchange Online for calendar functionality
  - Microsoft Graph API access

2. **Microsoft Entra App Registration**: An app registered in Microsoft
  Entra (Azure AD) with:
  - **Application Type**: 
    - Public client application (for device code flow)
    - Or confidential client (for client secret flow)
  - **Redirect URI**: Not required for either flow
  - **API Permissions**:
    - For interactive use (Delegated permissions):
      - `Calendars.ReadWrite` (Delegated)
      - `Contacts.Read` (Delegated)
      - `User.Read` (Delegated)
    - For automated use (Application permissions):
      - `Calendars.ReadWrite` (Application)
      - `Contacts.Read` (Application)
  - **Admin Consent**: Granted for all permissions
  - **Client Secret**: Required only for non-interactive authentication

3. **Public Client Flow**: Enabled in the app registration to support
   device code authentication

### How It Works

**Device Code Flow (Interactive):**
1. **Authentication**: You'll authenticate via browser using a device code
2. **User Context**: Runs as the authenticated user
3. **Data Reading**: Reads contacts from your Microsoft 365 account via Graph API
4. **Calendar Management**: Creates/updates events in your dedicated calendar
5. **Recurrence**: Events repeat annually on the same date
6. **Smart Updates**: Detects when contact birthdays change and updates events accordingly

**Client Secret Flow (Non-Interactive):**
1. **Authentication**: Authenticates using client ID, tenant ID, and client secret
2. **User Context**: Runs with application permissions (can access any user's data)
3. **Data Access**: Same as above, but requires specifying target user for full automation
4. **Ideal for**: GitHub Actions, scheduled tasks, CI/CD pipelines

### Data Privacy

- All data stays within your Microsoft 365 tenant
- No data is sent to third-party services (except Sentry if configured)
- Authentication tokens are stored locally and managed by Microsoft's SDK
- The app only accesses data you explicitly grant permission for

### Permissions Explained

- **Calendars.ReadWrite**: Required to create and update birthday events
  in your calendar
- **Contacts.Read**: Required to read birthday information from your
  contacts
- **User.Read**: Required for basic authentication and to identify the
  logged-in user

## Security Considerations

- **Device Code Flow**: Provides secure, interactive authentication without storing secrets
- **Client Secret Flow**: Requires careful secret management - never commit secrets to version control
- **Client Secret Storage**: 
  - For local use: Store in `.env` file (gitignored)
  - For GitHub Actions: Use encrypted repository secrets
  - Rotate secrets regularly
- **Permissions**: Apply principle of least privilege
  - Use Delegated permissions for interactive use
  - Use Application permissions only when necessary for automation
- **Admin Consent**: Ensures proper authorization for all permissions
- **Secret Expiration**: Client secrets expire - monitor and rotate them before expiration

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

**Device Code Flow:**
1. Verify your `CLIENT_ID` and `TENANT_ID` are correct
2. Ensure admin consent was granted for the Delegated API permissions
3. Check that public client flows are enabled in your app registration
4. Make sure you complete the device code authentication flow in the browser

**Client Secret Flow:**
1. Verify `CLIENT_ID`, `TENANT_ID`, and `CLIENT_SECRET` are all correct
2. Check that the client secret hasn't expired
3. Ensure admin consent was granted for the Application API permissions
4. Verify the secret value is copied correctly (no extra spaces/characters)

### Permission Errors

If you get permission-related errors:

1. Verify all required permissions are granted in the app registration
2. Ensure admin consent is provided
3. Check that the user account has access to contacts and calendars
